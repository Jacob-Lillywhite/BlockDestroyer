A simple java game where the player bounces a ball off a paddle to destroy blocks!

### Future Improvements?: 
- [ ] Fix Corner Collision Behaviour (Corners register multiple collisions currently)
- [ ] Ability to dynamically change levels (Currently it uses a switch statement with hardcoded levels, ideally I'd like to read any number of 2D arrays and generate levels accordingly)
